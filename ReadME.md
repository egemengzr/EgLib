# Egemen Embedded Library  
*A lightweight and register-level embedded library for STM32 and ESP32*  

## Introduction  
This library was initially developed for the **STM32F10x series**, but it is being expanded to support other microcontrollers like **ESP32**. It is designed to be a minimal and efficient **register-level** library, avoiding the overhead of larger HAL or SPL frameworks.  

Since this is a personal project, the library is **still in development**, and there might be **some bugs**. I am actively working on improvements in my free time. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!

## Features  
‚úÖ **GPIO Control** ‚Äì Read, write, and configure GPIO pins at the register level.  
‚úÖ **Basic Delay Function** ‚Äì Implemented using **SysTick** for STM32 and **FreeRTOS vTaskDelay** for ESP32.  
‚úÖ **Multi-Platform Support** ‚Äì Easily configurable for different MCUs.  
‚úÖ **Minimalistic & Efficient** ‚Äì No HAL, no SPL, just pure low-level control.

## Supported Microcontrollers  
- ‚úÖ STM32F103 (tested)  
- ‚è≥ STM32F303 (planned)  
- ‚úÖ ESP32 (partially implemented)

## Getting Started  

### 1. Clone the Repository  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/egemen-lib.git
```
---

### 2. Configure Your Target MCU
Edit the config.h file and select your target microcontroller:

```c
#define STM32F103
//#define ESP32
```
---

### 3. Include in Your Project

Add the following to your main C file:

```c
#include "egemen.h"

int main(void) {
    GPIO_Init(GPIOA_BASE, (1 << 5), GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT);
    
    while (1) {
        PinWrite(GPIOA_BASE, (1 << 5), 1); // LED ON
        Delay(500);
        PinWrite(GPIOA_BASE, (1 << 5), 0); // LED OFF
        Delay(500);
    }
}
```
